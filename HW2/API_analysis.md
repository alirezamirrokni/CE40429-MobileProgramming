API Analysis
The provided Mastermind API offers endpoints for game operations but could be improved for clarity and developer ergonomics. Clearer RESTful endpoints such as POST /games to create a game, POST /games/{id}/guesses to submit guesses, and GET /games/{id} for status would make integration straightforward. Responses should consistently use JSON with well-documented fields including gameId, status, attempts, history, and timestamps.

Enhancements
Add API authentication (API keys or tokens), rate limiting, and versioning. Include example requests and full JSON schemas in the docs. Support WebSocket or server-sent events if real-time multiplayer or live updates are desired.

Operational Notes
Provide error codes and meaningful HTTP status codes, logging for audit and debugging, and consider data retention and privacy for saved games, especially if user accounts are supported.
